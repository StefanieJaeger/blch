# Voting App

## Hand-In 1: Initial Plan
We intend to create a voting application that allows an admin user to create polls with yes/no questions, and regular users to vote on these polls.
The application will be built using only frontend technologies and will not require a backend server, since all data will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
The communication to the Blockchain will be handled by a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet and will be interacted with using a library such as ethers.js or viem.

### Initial Tech-Stack plan:
- React/TypeScript
- Material UI as component library
- Viem for blockchain interaction
